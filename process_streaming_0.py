"""

Streaming Process: Uses port 9999

Create a fake stream of data. 
Use temperature data from the batch process.

Reverse the order of the rows to read OLDEST data first.

Important! 

We'll stream forever - or until we read the end of the file. 
Use use Ctrl-C to stop. (Hit Control key and c key at the same time.)
