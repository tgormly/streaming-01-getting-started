"""
Batch Process B: Second transformation

Read from a file, transform, write to a new file.
In this case, covert degree C to degree K.

Note: 
This is a batch process, but the file objects we use are 
often called 'file-like objects' or 'streams'.
Streaming differs in that the input data is unbounded.

Use logging, very helpful when working with batch and streaming processes.
